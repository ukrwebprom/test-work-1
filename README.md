# test-work-1
This is a test project, made on **Career skills. Tech part** course.

## Used technologies
The project is created on React. The initial projet was created with Create React App. \
Used [Single Page Apps for GitHub Pages](https://github.com/rafgraph/spa-github-pages) to prevent 404 when refreshing on GitHub Pages \
Styling with SASS for simplification of nested styles. (https://www.npmjs.com/package/sass) \
Combining styles with CLSX library. (https://www.npmjs.com/package/clsx) \
Getting data from backend with AXIOS. (https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios#axios-api) \
Also used ready components from [Material UI](https://mui.com/)

## Why not use paginated queries?
While we show All the cards, paginated requests work like a charm. Mockapi backend allows requests with searchParams, such as /tweeter-users?page=1&limit=3
